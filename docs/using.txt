cipherScript utilizes SJCL (as found at 
https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/blob/ecc/sjcl.js) to provide
all functions required for ECC, as well as some basic AES and encoding
functions for compatibility when using ECC.

SHA3, SHA512, AES (as used for string encryption with passwords), as 
well as some encoding tools come from CRYPTOJS (as found at
http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/).
